This is my_first project using ArcGispro 
I’ve drawn various residential areas, hospitals, shops, malls, stadiums, mosques, schools, bus stations, youth centers, fire stations, banks, and other government facilities. Additionally, I’ve used spatial queries such as merge, union, buffer, intersect, symmetric difference, clip, and identity.
